# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: JSX is a syntantic sugar originally created for React. JSX allows developers to code HTML within JS. JSX is essentially a hybrid of JS and HTML together. A difference between HTML and JSX, is JSX requires a sigle parent element return, or the code will "break". HTML does not have this requirement.

Researched answer: JSX stands for JavaScript syntax extension.   It is a JavaScript extension that allows us to describe React's object tree using a syntax that resembles that of an HTML template.   It is just an XML-like extension that allows us to write JavaScript that looks like markup and have it returned from a component. JSX uses className attributes due to class being a reserve word in JS, while HTML uses the class attribute.

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

Your answer: Yarn is a JavaScript package manager created by Facebook. Yarn stands for Yet Another Resource Negotiator.  It is a different option to NPM when installing, uninstalling, and managing package dependencies from the NPM registry or GitHub repositories.
